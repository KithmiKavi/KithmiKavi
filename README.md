## 🐾 Github Footprint

⚡I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. This is why I share most of my work on GitHub for others to see. My hope is that someday someone will find my work useful.

## 📈 Github Performance

⚡I do my best to keep a healthy work-life balance. Since I'm still a student who also has to work full-time, I sometimes find it hard to maintain all other aspects of my life in balance which results in a decline in Github activity. However, I do my best to keep this balance and to not disrupt the flow.

## 🏆 Github Achievements
⚡ With the free time I have, I always try to do something valuable for myself and for others. These content I upload to GitHub has allowed me to achieve quite a lot within a very small amount of time. These small achievements make me motivated to continue expanding my skillset and to share more and more with others on the internet. I hope I'm able to continue this all throughout my journey as an engineer.

## 🗝️ Key Languages

⚡I am interested in a variety of fields. I find myself comfortable mostly in Windows programming. However, I am interested in hardware description languages like Verilog as well. On the other hand, I also do low-level programming such as C/C++ and Assembly. Even though not my strong point, I'm also capable of working with web development tools. When it comes to scripting, I'm quite confident with Python.

```
𓇲 Verilog            ⭐⭐⭐⭐               💻 Visual Basic      ⭐⭐⭐                 🖥️ Visual C#         ⭐⭐⭐⭐
