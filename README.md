**🤔 Knowing how to code makes you look at the world from a different perspective 🌏. That's why I'm so passionate about coding. Hello World 👋; welcome to my Github profile. I'm still a student and am 24 years of age, so there's a long journey ahead of me 🙆. I like to dream 💬 big and to see other peoples dreams come true. I'm a tech nerd 🐱‍💻 and a coding enthusiast. Hope you might find me amusing.🤩**

🧑‍🔬 As an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate from [Sri Lanka Technological Campus](www.sltc.ac.lk), I'm interested in all things electronic and programming related. I spend most of my time working on my campus work and writing different pieces of code in my free time. I also like to fix electronic equipment and even design my own if I get the chance.

## 🐾 Github Footprint

⚡I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. This is why I share most of my work on Github for others to see. My hope is that some day someone will find my work useful.

![Github Metrics](https://metrics.lecoq.io/asankaSovis?template=classic&base=header%2C%20activity%2C%20community%2C%20repositories%2C%20metadata&base.indepth=false&base.hireable=false&base.skip=false&config.timezone=Asia%2FColombo)

## 📈 Github Performance

⚡I do my best to keep a healthy work-life balance. Since I'm still a student, I sometimes find it hard to maintain all other aspects of my life in balance which results in a decline in Github activity. However, I do my best to keep this balance and to not disrupt the flow.

## 🗝️ Key Languages

⚡I am interested in a variety of fields. I find myself comfortable mostly in windows programming. However, I am interested in hardware descriptions languages like Verilog as well. On the other hand, I also do low level programming such as C/C++ and Assembly. Eventhough not my strong point, I'm also capable of working with web development tools. When it comes to scripting, I'm quite confident with Python.

## 💡Highlight Projects

⚡These are some of the projects that I'm really proud of. I put a lot of effort into them since they can improve my knowledge on certain technologies. I plan to add more projects to this list and to continue developing these even further.

### 01. 💻 Eight Bit Computer Using FPGA
In this project I try to recreate the eight bit computer that [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater) creates in his famous [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). However, the difference is that I intend to use FPGAs and the Verilog HDL for this task. My goal was to use this as a learning opportunity to sharpen my knowledge in FPGAs and Verilog.
- *Key Technologies* - 𓇲 Verilog | 𓇲 HDL
- *Status* - 🔄 working
- *Repository* - [eight_bit_computer](https://github.com/asankaSovis/eight_bit_computer)

### 02. 🔐 Muragala Password Manager
The goal of this project is to create a safe yet simple password manager that is easy to use. With this goal in mind, I created both a Python CLI, a C# library as well as a C# CLI application of it. I am even working on a GUI application of it. I still continue to improve this application and will add more functionalities in the future.
- *Key Technologies* - 🐍 Python | 🖥️ Visual C#
- *Status* - 🔄 working
- *Repository* - [password-manager-Python](https://github.com/asankaSovis/password-manager-Python)

### 03. 🔥 Prometheus Fire Alarm System
This project was intended to create a next-generation fire alarm system that is both robust and smart. It has the capability to successfully detect and even extinguish fires while also giving full control to the controller remotely. The command panel even has the capability to manage multiple of these fire alarm modules which gives a building much more safety when it comes to fires. I have even uploaded a demonstration to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y) that shows the fire alarm system in action.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C++ | 🖥️ Visual C# | ♾️ Arduino
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [prometheus-fire-alarm](https://github.com/asankaSovis/prometheus-fire-alarm)
